# D_FLIP_FLOP_4BIT_Verification_SystemVerilog
This project verifies a 4-bit D Flip-Flop design using SystemVerilog. It checks correct data storage on the rising clock edge, proper reset operation, and stable output behavior. The verification ensures reliable performance and accurate timing for sequential logic applications.
